# Bill Splitter

### Breakdown and Future Aspirations

This application will take images of receipts and allow the user to modify them and track payments for splitting the 
bill. Currently, the Tesseract OCR is used, although it is intended to develop a custom OCR at a later date. This digital copy of the classes.Receipt can be edited before saving to ensure the digital reflection is correct, furthermore extra details can be added by the user. 

The user can label separate items on the classes.Receipt for separate people and calculate each persons final total.
